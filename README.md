Hi, my name is Cheyenne Pourkay, and my GitHub name is xposea. I'm fairly new to Computer Science, as I've only been coding for about two months now.

So far, my favorite 'projects' have included doing Advent of Code 2021, and making Discord Bots. I plan to push AoC Solutions over the upcoming weeks in order to help new coders like myself figure out these fun puzzles. 

My current tech stack is fairly minimal, and includes Java, C, and R. I am currently working towards learning GoLang as well as Python. Feel free to add me on Discord - Dylan#2999, or email me at Cheyenne.Pourkay@gmail.com if you have any questions or suggestions!
